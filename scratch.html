					<h2> Name Assignment Project </h2>
					<p>
					 <img src="images/Name Project Screenshot.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					</p>
					<h2>Description:</h2>
					<p> The name assignment was a basic project on Scratch done in the first week of school, in which we had to program the individual letters of our name. 
					The prompt mandated that there be at least three unique behaviors in total for the name, whenever the green tag was written. 
					For my project in particular, all of the individual characters were scattered throughout the Scratch player upon the pressing of the green flag, and a process of aligning would occur whenever the SPACEBAR was pressed.
					</p>
					<h2> Concepts Learned:</h2>
					<ul>
							<li>Using event blocks- Whenever the green flag is clicked, the program initiates </li>
							<li>Looks- Being able to manipulates looks</li>
							<li> Conditional statements- I used if statements to detect the location of particular 
							sprites, and have them respond accordingly </li>
							<li> Used loops- As the instruction prescribed, I used a forever block </li>
							<li> Sprites- In this instance, I created my own sprites </li>
							<li> Movement- In the beginning, all of the characters were scattered, 
							but upon the press of a button, they all move to their respective, 
							parallel locations with movement blocks. </li>
					
				<h2> Computer Buying Project </h2>
				<p>

				</p>
				<h2> Description: </h2>
				<p> The Computer Buying Project was a project where one had to create a presentation on Scratch in which 4 computer options were compared and then a winner would be determined based upon a set of computer criteria. 
				In this particular project, one had the choice of working individually or in a group, and I opted to work with a partner. 
				In the end, we had to present our project up in front of the rest of our class 
				</p>
				<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
				<ul>
						<li> Using event blocks- I learned how to use “When backdrop changes to X block” </li>
						<li> Looks- I learned how to assemble conversations in Scratch </li>
						<li> Conditional statements- I learned how to detect whenever there was a change in background 
						and have the sprites react accordingly </li>
						<li> Used loops- Though I utilised no new loops, I made extensive use of the loops I knew how to manipulate </li>
						<li> Sprites- All of the sprites were provided by Scratch and were not of my own design </li>
						<li> Movement- There was hardly any sprite movement during this presentation, as the slides would simply change instead. 
						However, there was one prominent instance in which one character walked into a room at the start of a particular slide,
						and departed in the opposite way at the end. </li>

			 <h2> Final Project </h2>
			<p>
			<img src="images/Scratch Final Project (Escape from the Forest) Screenshot.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
			</p>
			<h2> Description: </h2>
			<p> In this final Scratch project, people were to work individually and opt to create either a game or a story, and I eventually selected the story option. 
			This particular story involves a girl who, upon her infirm mother’s request, ventures out into the forest in pursuit of some potential cure. 
			In compliance to the rules of the project, the story was completely autonomous upon the initial pressing of the green flag, and it had numerous scenes and conversations, 
			as well as a reasonable amount of characters to engage in conversation.


			</p>
			<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
			<ul>
					<li> Using event blocks- In this particular project, I made first use of the “When I receive BROADCAST”. </li>
					<li> Looks- In one particular scene, the costume of a character changed upon encountering the main character. </li>
					<li> Conditional statements- The conditional statements mostly pertained to only initiating a line of code upon the receival of a broadcast or the changing of a slide. </li>
					<li> Used loops- Loops were not used as broadcasts rendered them obsolete, except for one instance in which “REPEAT” blocks were used for an animation.  </li>
					<li> Sprites- This was the first time I used broadcasts to conduct the interactions between the various different sprites. Additionally, the origin of the sprites was mixed, 
					as while some were self-created, others were Scratch’s </li>
					<li> Movement- The main character moves significantly throughout the various scenes of the story, and does so autonomously. </li>
