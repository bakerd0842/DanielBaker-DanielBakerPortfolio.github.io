		<h1>Jeroo Unit 1 </h1>
		<h2> FencedIn </h2>

		<h2> Diamond </h2>
					<p>
					 <img src="images/DiamondMethods.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					</p>
					
					<h2>Description:</h2>
					<p> In this Unit, there were the labs Diamond, Nets, and FencedIn. In this particular unit, the concepts
					learned include how to place Jeroo in their environment, and how to manipulate the Jeroo's movement. In addition, we 
					became accustomed to using Jeroo so that we could expand upon that knowledge in the future.
					</p>
					<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
					<ul>
						<li> How to place in a Jeroo </li>
						<li> How to enable the Jeroo to interact with the environment </li>
						<li> Calculating the number of necessary times to repeat a particular function </li>

		<h2> Water Hazard-1 </h2>
					<p>

		<h2> Great Escape</h2>
					<p>
					 <img src="images/GreatEscape.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					</p>
					
					<h2>Description:</h2>
					<p> In this Unit, there were the labs Escape, Flowers, LED, Water Hazard-1, and Box. In this particular unit, the concepts
					learned include how to create a method and the differences between coding within the main method versus the side methods.
					This difference manifests in that in the main method, one must place (enter Jeroo name).(x function), while in a side method,
					one can simply format it as (x function). In addition, we learned to apply a particular method multiple times
					</p>
					<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
					<ul>
						<li> How to create a method </li>
						<li> The differences between coding in the main method and side methods </li>
						<li> Applying the same method multiple times for one particular Jeroo </li>
	
		<h1>Jeroo Unit 3 </h1>
		<h2> Water Hazard-2 </h2>
					<p>
					 <img src="images/Water2.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					</p>
		<h2> LockUp </h2>
					<p>
					 <img src="images/LockUp.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					</p>
					
					<h2>Description:</h2>
					<p> In this Unit, there were the labs Lockup, Water Hazard-2, Spiral, Flowers-2, and Pinball. In this particular unit, the primary concept
					learned was how to produce loops that will always output a particular outcome if a particular condition is met. This was accomplished
					through the use of conditionals such as "If"s or "While"s. 
					</p>
					<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
					<ul>
						<li> How to create loops </li>
						<li> How to apply methods to multiple Jeroos</li>
						<li> How to experiment with variables, although this was not yet highly important </li>
						
		<h1>Jeroo Unit 4 </h1>
		<h2> Alley Run </h2>
					<p>
					 <img src="images/AlleyRun.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					</p>
		<h2> Recursive Box </h2>
					<p>
					 <img src="images/RecurisveBox.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					</p>
					
					<h2>Description:</h2>
					<p> In this Unit, there were the labs Chaos, RecursiveBox, Spiral, and AlleyRun. In this particular unit, the concepts
					learned include how to use an additional conditional, the "If/else" statement, as well as Recursion. Recursion is a very
					helpful computing trick in which, upon being activated and having the rest of its content fulfilled through another method, a
					particular method will invoke the original method that triggered it again. This perpetuates the operation of the code, although
					particular factors can still be integrated to be fulfilled at a particular point to prevent further Recursion
					</p>
					<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
					<ul>
						<li> How to establish a Recursive Statement </li>
						<li> How to check for multiple variables concurrently,and be able to act accordingly </li>
						<li> Using the "If/else" statements </li>
