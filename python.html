		<h1>Python Unit 1 </h1>
		<h2>Variables Lab </h2>
						<p>
						 <img src="Images/VariablesComplete.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
						</p>
						
						<h2>Description:</h2>
						<p>The Variables Lab is actually comprised of two segments, “variables.py” and “math.py”, the former dealing with the user’s name, and the latter primarily focusing on the dynamics of math in Python, and familiarising the user with said dynamics, but in each, the program integrates an input and prints the output of its respective code. Within the lab, the rudiments of Python, such as printing and the creation and manipulation of variables are introduced.					</p>
						<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Receiving input originating from the user </li>
							<li>The logistics of printing within Python </li>
							<li>The logistics of variables </li>
						<li>Basic Mathematical concepts like addition, subtraction,multiplication, and addition </li>
						<li>Modulus (I was not familiar with the concept prior) </li>


	<h1>Python Unit 2 </h1>
	<h2>Collide Lab </h2>
						<p>
						 <img src="Images/Collide.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
						</p>
						
						<h2>Description:</h2>
						<p>In this assignment, the character defined in the previous labs with the same characteristics and methods is programmed in order to interact properly with another impassible object, that being a wall. Subsequently, the use of “if/else” statements is necessitated, and so they are introduced in this lab 					</p>
						<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
						<ul>
							<li>If/else statements </li>
							<li>Incorporation of another object into pygame </li>
							<li>Interaction (including collision) of multiple objects, using ChangedRecs </li>
						<li>Use of multiple class files </li>


	<h1>Python Unit 3 </h1>
	<h2>Timer Lab </h2>
						<p>
						 <img src="Images/Timer.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
						</p>
						
						<h2>Description:</h2>
						<p>In this particular lab, a program should be written that counts down from a numerical value that the user defines to zero. The numerical value that user defines will be done so through asking the user, and the pygame timer will be utilised to pause the loop for 1 second. The continual decrease from the set value to zero will be displayed in seconds first and then in seconds. 					</p>
						<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Use of the Pygame Timer </li>
							<li>Use of loops to repeat code a definitive number of times </li>
							<li>Representing time in Python </li>

	<h1>Python Unit 4 </h1>
	<h2>Costume Change Lab </h2>
						<p>
						 <img src="Images/CostumeChange.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
						</p>
						
						<h2>Description:</h2>
						<p>The objective of this lab is to devise a program with the capacity to change the subject’s image according to the direction in which it is facing. Since the subject is to face the direction in which it is moving, the image will correspond to the direction in which it is moving, as well. Each particular costume will be invoked through the use of a list of costume and a particular index that corresponds to each individual element in the entire set. 					</p>
						<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The loading of multiple image files to a particular object (permitted through a list) </li>
							<li>The basic concept of creating lists </li>
							<li>The use of indices to invoke their respective elements </li>



	<h1>Python Final Project </h1>
	<h2>Costume Catastrophe </h2>
						<p>
						 <img src="Images/CostumeCatastrophe.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
						</p>
						
						<h2>Description:</h2>
						<p>Within this particular game, one is a assigned a red shirt to control with the “a” and “d” keys, to move left and right, respectively. With this capacity to move, the player must pursue green shirts and avoid blue shirts, which will increase and decrease the player’s score, respectively. The player will cycle through multiple levels, and with each successive level, the pace would increase.			</p>
						<h2> Concepts Learned </h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The displaying of multiple variables onto the screen</li>
							<li>The interaction of numerous variables
