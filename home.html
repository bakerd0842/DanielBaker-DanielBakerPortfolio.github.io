					<h2> Basic Biography </h2>
					<p> Hello, my name is Daniel</p>
					
					<h2> Here are some of my hobbies<h2>
					
					<h3> Karate <h3>
					<img src="http://www.kiakarateusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/New-Karate-Classes-Forming-No-Background2.png"/ width="400" height="300">
					<p> I have been doing Karate for multiple years now, and I often get 5 hours of practice a week. 
					Just recently, I received my black belt, but I realize that this is merely a new beginning, not an end.
					In Karate, we practice kata as well as Foot, Hand, and Knife self-defense. 
					In more advance ranks, we utilize weapons such as Bo staffs, Nunchuks, and Escrima <p>
					
					<h3> Reading <h3>
					<img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/360031/file-2431800788-jpg/body_reading.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					<p> Reading is paramount to learning, and even reading fiction can enhance one's academic ability and knowledge of the world.
					However, though I often don't get around to it till the weekends, I often read independent of school as it can be quite fun.
					My favorite genres to read are non-fiction or historical fiction, although science fiction or dystopian future type books can be intriguing,
					though I regard them as often over-rated<p>
					
					<h3> Acting/Videography <h3>
					<img src="https://hollywoodsapien.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/actors.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					<p>It should be noted that I have taken no classes in these areas and thus my ability in doing either is lacklustre, but I love videography and acting.
					In the past, I used to have a Youtube channel where I would upload and edit random skits of me with my family or friends, although recently I have largely been unactive
					and my channel is thus stagnant. I love to act, and often did so on my aforementioned Youtube site. In fact, though I never took any acting classes, I received the lead role of the sixth grade play<p>
					
					<h3> Learning <h3>
					<img src="https://a2ua.com/learning/learning-006.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
					<p>If I had to select a favorite hobby, it would be learning. This is because as though you may get bored doing so, the more you know, the more you realise that you don't know. In addition, learning new things opens up so many new opportunities</p>
